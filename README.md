A collection of MCBE addons for realm and server owners.

Current public available packs:
- Realm Transfer: Intended for realms, sends players that join your realm to a BDS server.

Intended future additions:
- Anti Combat Log: Highly configurable anti combat logging system. Players loot will be dropped if they leave during combat.
- CPS Limiter: Block attacks from people who are clicking a higher CPS than they are allowed.
- Spawn Protection: Disables players from being able to damage each other in spawn or interacting with certain blocks.
- Custom Chat: Highly configurable custom player chat messages.
- Custom Knockback: Real time configurable custom knockback for players.

## Feel free to copy code and implement it into your own packs!
To import packs after you edit config files, zip the entire folder contents (not the folder) and rename the zip file extenstion to .mcpack and open it.
If you zip the entire folder, rename the extension to .mcaddon and open it. The pack will upload to your game.
